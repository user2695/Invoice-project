# Mind map

I used nodejs library because i believe i am most comfortable with nodejs for backend.

For front-end i used ejs. I have also used MVC design pattern so that it can be easy to read and debug.

I liked to part where i had to create the pdf for hard coded data. But i am facing problems with sending it to email.
